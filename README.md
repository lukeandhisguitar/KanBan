# KanBan
KanBan is a compact and user-tailored personal-project-management tool, built in html + flask + Qwen API with Render. 

It was first designed to boost efficiency for the developer's day job, who works in a private equity firm as an analyst. 

The main function includes the usual project tracking, a-bit-more advanced AI analysing (where LLM extracting and analysing key text info from files)... and more to come.

The project is still under early development, currently serving as a local tool for DV.  (DV just lost 10k+ characters this week due to an unexpected localstorage override triggered by what-I-yet-to-figure-out)

The current DV plan is cloudification, followed by more tech-side stuff like adding picture-analysing function, or improving prompt for M&A and NPA disposal. (which is a pain-in-the-ass because of the messy markdown format when the prompt becomes tensely detailed)
